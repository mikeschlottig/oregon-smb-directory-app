# CRITICAL DATABASE ISSUE HANDOFF

## Problem Summary
Oregon SMB Directory Worker is not properly fetching businesses from D1 database. Most city/industry combinations showing 0-1 businesses instead of expected 30-150+ businesses.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Database has mixed industry formats:**
   - Some entries: `"electricians"`, `"plumbers"` (slug format) ✅
   - Some entries: `"Legal Services"`, `"Roofing Services"` (display name format) ❌
   - Some entries: `"lawfirms"` (correct slug) ✅

2. **Worker query logic partially fixed but still failing**
   - Added industry mapping for variants
   - Fixed method binding issue
   - Local testing shows intermittent success (30 businesses) vs fallback (1 business)

## Database Contents (VERIFIED)
```
Portland: electricians (60), plumbers (52), real-estate (257), general-contractors (118), roofers (30), Legal Services (29)
Salem: electricians (30), plumbers (60), real-estate (30), general-contractors (90), Legal Services (30), Roofing Services (59)
Eugene: electricians (30), plumbers (60), real-estate (60), general-contractors (120), Legal Services (60)
Medford: electricians (60), plumbers (49), real-estate (150), general-contractors (210), roofers (90), lawfirms (149)
Grants Pass: electricians (30), plumbers (51), real-estate (90), general-contractors (149), roofers (5), lawfirms (84)
Roseburg: electricians (30), plumbers (48), real-estate (114), general-contractors (30), Legal Services (59)
```

## Current State
- **Bindings**: D1 database correctly configured in wrangler.toml
- **Local Dev**: wrangler dev shows D1 connection working intermittently
- **Production**: Broken - most combinations showing minimal results
- **Test Results**: Portland/electricians works (30 businesses), others inconsistent

## Immediate Actions Needed
1. **RESTART FRESH**: Consider clean rewrite of database query logic
2. **Fix Industry Names**: Standardize all database entries to use slugs only
3. **Test Matrix**: All 36 city/industry combinations need systematic testing
4. **Deployment Order**: Local test → GitHub → Production (not production first!)

## Files Modified (Ready for Fresh Start)
- `src/index.ts` - BusinessDataService class with industry mapping
- `wrangler.toml` - D1 bindings configured correctly
- `CLAUDE.md` - Testing protocol rules added

## Database Commands for Reference
```bash
# Check industry variants
wrangler d1 execute oregon-smb-directory --remote --command="SELECT DISTINCT industry FROM businesses ORDER BY industry"

# Test specific query
wrangler d1 execute oregon-smb-directory --remote --command="SELECT COUNT(*) FROM businesses WHERE city='Portland' AND industry='electricians'"
```

## Next Session Priority
1. Clean database query rewrite OR
2. Database normalization to fix industry name inconsistencies OR
3. Start from scratch with simplified approach

**Status**: Database logic partially working but unreliable. Need systematic approach to fix completely.
